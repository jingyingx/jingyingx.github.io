My research covers the following topics:

# Aspect and Telicity
Why do adults and children sometimes disagree about sentences like “She ate the cookies” when not all cookies are fully eaten? We argue that developmental and cross-linguistic variability in telicity judgments arise not from differences in core aspectual meanings, but from how these meanings are pragmatically evaluated in context.

# Modeling Syntactic Parameter Setting
We propose an input-driven, hierarchical “Clustering Approach” to parameter setting that unifies strengths of direct parameter setting and grammar selection, resolves a key issue in prior hybrid models, and scales to larger parameter spaces.

# Acquisition of Mandarin Control Structues
How do toddlers interpret who does the action in sentences like *X xiang chi-fan* 'X wanted to eat' and *X jiao Y chi-fan* 'X asked Y to eat'? Using the Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm (IPLP), we show that Mandarin-speaking two-year-olds already track subject control and distinguish it from object control, offerring early evidence on the knowledge of PRO and support continuity in language acquisition.

# Mandarin Count-Mass Issue
Mandarin noun countability has been explained either by a **syntactic** account, where classifiers determine and specify countability, leaving bare nouns mass/underspecified, or by a **semantic** account, where nouns are lexically count vs. mass based on denotation or classifier-collocation constraints. In this project, we present experimental evidence that Mandarin nouns are underspecified for countability, and that size-/shape-denoting adjectives, analogous to classifiers, supply an individuation function that determines countability. Children acquire adjectival individuation slowly, in parallel with the protracted acquisition of classifier individuation.

#  Non-Interrogative Use of Mandarin Negative Wh-Pronoun Construction *mei...shenme* 'not...what'
In Mandarin, the *mei…shenme* (‘not…what’) construction supports a categorical **None** reading (e.g., *Xiaozhu mei chi shenme dongxi.* ‘Xiaozhu didn’t eat anything at all.’) and a scalar Insignificance reading (e.g., *Xiaozhu mei chi shenme dongxi.* ‘Xiaozhu ate very little.’). We find the L2 pattern mirrors L1: **None** before **Insignificance**, but on a more gradual curve. We consider linguistic and non-linguistic factors (e.g., input frequency, task and pragmatics factors) to account for similarities and differences across L1 and L2 acquisition.
