Welcome to my NLP portfolio, which highlights my applied NLP projects and critical readings of foundational NLP/LLM papers from both computational and linguistic perspectives. My goal is to combine rigorous linguistic theory with modern machine learning methods to better understand how NLP models interpret, structure, and learn from language.

## Featured Projects

### **1. Authorship Attribution on IMDB62 (2025)**
A high-performing, fully interpretable authorship attribution pipeline combining:
- Character TF–IDF  
- Word TF–IDF  
- Rich stylometric features (punctuation, discourse markers, lexical richness, POS patterns, modals, superlatives)  
- LinearSVC classifier  
- Neural baseline (BiLSTM)

**Results:**  
- LinearSVC: 98.97% accuracy  
- BiLSTM: ~42% accuracy  
- ~6 points higher accuracy than reported BERTAA (~93%)

**Skills:** Feature engineering, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, spaCy, model evaluation
