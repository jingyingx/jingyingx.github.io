Hello! I'm a PhD candidate in the [Linguistics Program](https://lilac.msu.edu/linguistics/) of Michigan State University (MSU). My research focuses on syntax, semantics and first language acquisition of the two areas. I use experimental and computational approaches to study how children acquire their first language. My advisor is [Cristina Schmitt](https://people.cal.msu.edu/schmit12/). [Alan Munn](https://amunn.github.io/), [Alan Hezao Ke](https://hezaoke.weebly.com/), and [Brian Buccola](https://brianbuccola.com/) are also on my committee. 

I'm part of the [MSU Language Acquisition Lab](https://www.msuacquisition.org/index.html), Semantics-Pragmatics Lab, and [Minimalism, Learning and 
Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/mlclab). I'm also doing the [Interdepartmental Graduate Specialization in Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.msu.edu/graduate.html). 

You can find a current copy of my CV [here](http://jingyingx.github.io/jingyingxu-cv_sept_2025.pdf).
