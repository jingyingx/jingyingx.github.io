Hello! I'm a PhD student in the [Linguistics Program](https://lilac.msu.edu/linguistics/) of Michigan State University (MSU). My research focuses on first language acquisition of syntax and semantics. I use experimental and computational approaches to study how children acquire their first language. My advisor is [Cristina Schmitt](https://people.cal.msu.edu/schmit12/). [Alan Munn](https://amunn.github.io/), [Brian Buccola](https://brianbuccola.com/), and [Alan Hezao Ke](https://hezaoke.weebly.com/) are also on my committee. 

Before Attending MSU, I received my MA in Linguistics at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Xiaolu Yang](https://www.dfll.tsinghua.edu.cn/dfllen/info/1060/1119.htm). Before that, I did undergrad at Soochow University, where I worked with [Aijun Huang](https://sfl.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Data/View/4662).

## News!
- I did a poster presentation titled "Demonstratives but not verbs cause non-culmination in Mandarin incremental-theme predicates: Evidence from children and adults" at [WCCFL 42](https://www.wccfl42.com/) during April 12-14 at the University of California, Berkeley. Download the poster [here](http://jingyingx.github.io/WCCFL_Poster_Jingying_Xu.pdf) if you are interested :)
- I’m presenting at [CLS 60](http://chicagolinguisticsociety.org/) (April 26–28, The University of Chicago), poster titled "Non-culmination in telic incremental theme predicates: An experimental study of Mandarin children and adults". Download the poster [here](http://jingyingx.github.io/CLS_Poster_Jingying_Xu.pdf) if you are interested :)
- I'm presenting at [SALT 34](https://saltconf.github.io/salt34/) (May 28-30, The University of Rochester).
